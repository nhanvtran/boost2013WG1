Pre-requesites:
1. Installation of ROOT
2. Installation of fastjet
3. Installation of fastjet/contrib

Workflow:
0. Store your data in a directory "analysis/data/"
1. Take LHE input, read in, compute stuff, make a ROOT TTree that holds all of the information
2. Plot the information

-------------------------

To compile the code for step 1:
$ make

To run the code for step 1: 
$ ./anaSubstructure "flavor" "ptbin" "nevents"

Inputs: 
flavor = "gg" or "qq"
ptbin = lower edge of the generated pT bin
nevents = number of events to run over

-------------------------

Example of how to  plot:
python plotter -b --ptbin 500
